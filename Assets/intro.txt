Welcome to the lobster game!

The Rules:

You have been forced by your tyrannical government to work as a lobster farmer on the Isle of Pain and Suffering.
To start off you get given £20! There are certain things you must understand to become a lobster farmer!

You can place you pots inshore or outshore, outshore pots having more lobsters in them.
BUT if there is bad weather then your offshore lobster pots will be washed away and you will have to pay for new ones!
Subsequently the price of inshore lobsters goes up!

   +------------------------------+
   |      Lobster Pot Values      |
   +------------------------------+
   | Weather | Inshore | Offshore |
   +---------+---------+----------+
   |    Good | £3      | £5       |
   +---------+---------+----------+
   +     Bad | £5      | -£6      +
   +---------+---------+----------+

Every day there is a 1 in 6 chance of bad weather!

If you have 3 days in a row of bad weather then you get a hurricane! If this happens and you have any lobster pots out
in the sea then you have to pay £150 for a new boat!

To get around this then you can work at the hotel. They will only pay you £15, but your boat is protected as is did not
need to go out!

You will be working a 5 day week with the weekends off. The govenment taxes people who have days off so you have to pay
£80 at the end of every week.

If at the end of a week you are at -£100 of less then you will be shot. GAME OVER!
